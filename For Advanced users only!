Here we will install smokeless to allow you to set a higher TDP. WARNING no responcability is accepted if you Brick your Ally!

You will need a keybaord attached to your ally through a hub and the usb with the files.

First download and extract the smokeless files to a FAT32 USB drive.

Extract the files to your usb with 7.zip

Boot up your ALLY with pressing volume down button a few times till you boot into BIOS

Press Y go to boot and select your usb drive as first boot device, save and exit, your Ally will now boot into smokeless.

Using your arrow keys select Device Manager press Enter

Go to AMD CBS enter

Place this file in /usr/bin/steamos-polkit-helpers  over write the file.

Now when you adjust the watt slider in Steam game mode it will show 3 - 15 watts this is ste by steam and cant be changed however the ally power scale is roughly x3 factor so 3 watts means real wattage of about 8 and 15watts will be 44watts with a fast higher boost of 53watts for a short time.
